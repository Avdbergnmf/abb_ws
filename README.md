# abb_ws
Linking an ABB robot to a Geomagic Touch haptic device using ROS

This is all the contents of the src folder.

The geomagic touch packages are edited versions of the original omni packages (LINK)
The ABB ros packages are stripped down versions of the original (LINK)

The pathmaker_abb package is custom written by me.
